Quick banana recipes
You can make easy, delicious pancakes by making a banana batter. Combine one mashed banana with two beaten eggs, and then cook the mixture as you would any other pancake batter. Add some quick oats to the batter for extra fiber and bulk.

If you freeze banana slices, you can use a high powered blender to blend them with cocoa powder to make chocolate “nice cream.”

For baked oatmeal muffins, combine overripe bananas with:

unsweetened applesauce
oats
milk
baking powder
a sweetener such as agave nectar or maple syrup
Once the ingredients are mixed, pour the batter into a muffin tin and pop it into the oven.
